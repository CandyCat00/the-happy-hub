      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you love animation, creativity, and adorable animals? So does Happy Spark, and the 400 others that are subscribed to her! However, despite the years she’s had on YouTube and the following she has,
        we are yet to get much background. Who are these colorful characters she’s created? Well, wonder no longer! I, a two year computer programmer studying html, 
        will be working side by side with Happy Spark, to give you the most accurate, and detailed profiles she has and more, all on one, adorable, easy access website! 
        Our hope is the give viewers the context they’ve been looking for, to make all her animations easier to understand and much more meaningful. 
        The untold stories will finally be told!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The main audiance of this site would obviosly be viewers of her channel which can range from any age, though youtube is officially for 12+.
        "Family-friendly" has always been my sisters main goal, and her style has always been colorful and cute. Therefore, I expect this to be the exact
        themes our aubdience will be looking for in the site. This encourages bright pastel, like colors, and cute fonts. The webite should be simple, and 
        not overly flashy, as that is what best matches the art style HappySpark uses in her animations. The website will also be aiming to please, mostly, 
        the curious viewers, who are looking for a little more from her content. If they are visiting this site, they are likely looking for context and 
        background info about the characters they often see, their history, and how they are connected.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/cbc5ea-01fdf6-fff75c-40798c-242038" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">[#cbc5ea]</td><td class="secondary">[#01fdf6]</td><td class="accent1">[#fff75c]</td><td class="accent2">[#40798c]</td></tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Hi Melody  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Handwritten Fonts are what I will be using 100%, as it matches the theme of her animations, also being hand-drawn. 
        I chose this one specificlly, as it uses bold and rounded edges, which matches the art style she uses. She almost never
        uses angled corners, and uses bold outlines.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Gaegu  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this one for mostly the same reason as the headlines. It matches her art style, but is also a little less flashy, 
        which I feel is an important quality for paragraphs to have. They should feel natural, unlike headlines, which need to 
        stand out. The writing of this font also feels a little sloppier than the headlines, which I think creates a more handmade feel
        Usually when someone writes notes, They'll be a lot more careful and neat with they titles, but sloppier with the actually 
        writing becasue there is a lot more to put down.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This is where the users start and get an idea of where they are. We need to welcome them and 
        give them a reason to stay. However, there won't be much content here.There will be a short 
        welcoming paragraph, maybe a little bit of news about the channel, like the last video upload,
        and then banners advertising the child content where most of the content will be.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Characters</h3>
      <p>
        This is the page that will contain the most information. It'll look somewhat like a wiki page,
        containing all sorts of infortaion about all the characters that Happy uses in her animations. 
        it may even contain things link, origins, making of, and evolutions of their design over the 
        years. There will also be images of the character that the user can look through.

      </ul>
      <h3>The Artist</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be all about HappySpark. It will be a simple profile like page, giving a simple 
        bio explaining who she is and how her channel came to be. It will contain interview questions as 
        topics, and the paragraphs will be anwers with quotes from HappySpark, herself. It'll also contain 
        information about her past channel names, and all the characters she has used to represent herself 
        in her animations.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        At the top there is a nave bar with a space for website logo.<br>
        Below that there will be her banner and her mascot logo will go in the circle.<br>
        Starting the actual content there will be a welcome banner showcasing a character welcomeing the viewer.<br>
        This will be followed by two other banners that will link the user to the two othe pages.<br>
        Finally, the footer lays at the bottom containing copyright informaation and links to Happy's social medias.
      </p>
      <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/9302465f-36ff-4dbd-8f13-95adddccdfd2%2FHubHomeWireframe.PNG?v=1624297358076">

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>         
        We start again with the same nav bar from the home page.<br>
        This time instead of a banner, we start with a horizontal scroll bar of images that will showcase each character.<br>
        When clicking this images a profile for that respective character will show up below.<br>
        There will be an image of their current design in the main image box with their name printed below.<br>
        The physical information box will contain basic appearance info, like height, fur color, and eye color.<br>
        The personal information box contains more complex info like the character origin and love interests.<br>
        Lastly, before the footer, there is a gallery of images, showcases all of the character's past designs and appearances.
      </p>

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>         
        This is a simple "about me" page.<br>
        In the box containing the header, there will be images of all of Happy's self insert characters.<br>
        The page will then continue as a fairly normal Q&A interview page.<br>
        There will also be a form at the bottom that lets the user submit their own questons and get replies via email, though this isn't currently on the wireframe.
