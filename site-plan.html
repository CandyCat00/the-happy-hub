      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you love animation, creativity, and adorable animals? So does Happy Spark, and the 400 others that are subscribed to her! However, despite the years she’s had on YouTube and the following she has,
        we are yet to get much background. Who are these colorful characters she’s created? Well, wonder no longer! I, a two year computer programmer studying html, 
        will be working side by side with Happy Spark, to give you the most accurate, and detailed profiles she has and more, all on one, adorable, easy access website! 
        Our hope is the give viewers the context they’ve been looking for, to make all her animations easier to understand and much more meaningful. 
        The untold stories will finally be told!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The main audiance of this site would obviosly be viewers of her channel which can range from any age, though youtube is officially for 12+.
        "Family-friendly" has always been my sisters main goal, and her style has always been colorful and cute. Therefore, I expect this to be the exact
        themes our aubdience will be looking for in the site. This encourages bright pastel, like colors, and cute fonts. The webite should be simple, and 
        not overly flashy, as that is what best matches the art style HappySpark uses in her animations. The website will also be aiming to please, mostly, 
        the curious viewers, who are looking for a little more from her content. If they are visiting this site, they are likely looking for context and 
        background info about the characters they often see, their history, and how they are connected.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/cbc5ea-01fdf6-fff75c-40798c-242038" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">[#cbc5ea]</td><td class="secondary">[#01fdf6]</td><td class="accent1">[#fff75c]</td><td class="accent2">[#40798c]</td></tr>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Hi Melody  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Handwritten Fonts are what I will be using 100%, as it matches the theme of her animations, also being hand-drawn. 
        I chose this one specificlly, as it uses bold and rounded edges, which matches the art style she uses. She almost never
        uses angled corners, and uses bold outlines.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Gaegu  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this one for mostly the same reason as the headlines. It matches her art style, but is also a little less flashy, 
        which I feel is an important quality for paragraphs to have. They should feel natural, unlike headlines, which need to 
        stand out.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.

      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.
